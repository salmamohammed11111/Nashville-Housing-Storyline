📍 Overview  

 This project uncovers housing market patterns in Nashville using Python-based visualizations. By analyzing over 48,000 property records, we dive into how sale price is influenced by property age, land use type, and structural value — turning raw real estate data into compelling visual narratives.  
 
📦 Dataset

The data contains residential transactions from the Nashville area, including:
- Property age and sale price
- Land use classification
- Building and land value
- Owner and parcel information
- 
🎯 Project Goals
- Clean and prepare large-scale real estate data
- Engineer insightful features like PropertyAge and BuildingToLandRatio
- Visualize market dynamics using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Communicate insights through visually polished storytelling
  
📊 Key Insights

- Newer properties consistently command higher sale prices, especially within Residential categories.
- Vacant and underutilized land clusters around lower sale values.
- A high Building-to-Land Ratio often signals premium development — but outliers exist.
- Most transactions occur under $500K, with price skew driven by a handful of luxury parcels.

📸 Sample Visual

A scatter plot comparing Sale Price vs Property Age, color-coded by land use, reveals how newer properties dominate higher value brackets. 
A line plot — it shows how the average sale price changes over time, with each point connected across years to highlight the trend.
That’s a bar chart, specifically showing the total number of property sales per year — a great way to visualize market activity over time.
